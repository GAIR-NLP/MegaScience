Below is a medical document extract.

# Extraction Task
Extract complete, independently solvable medical questions and answers from the document while following these guidelines:

## For Questions:
- Extract any explicit medical questions with their corresponding answers
- For implicit medical cases, conditions, diagnoses, or treatment protocols, convert them into well-formed questions ONLY if they can stand alone
- Ensure each extracted question contains ALL necessary clinical information to be understood and answered independently
- Include any relevant patient data, symptoms, test results, or clinical observations needed to fully understand the case
- Extract multiple questions separately if they exist
- If no medical question content can be extracted, return `[NO QA]`

## For Answers:
- Include the complete answer if provided in the extract
- Focus on capturing the main diagnosis, treatment plan, or clinical explanation
- Answers should be self-contained but don't need to be exhaustive
- Include key points from any detailed explanations or management plans provided

## Format:
Format each question-answer pair as:
Question: [Complete medical question with all context needed to understand the case]
Answer: [Complete answer with diagnosis, treatment, or explanation]

The extract is as follows:
`<EXAMPLE>`

Now process the extract and return the result.
