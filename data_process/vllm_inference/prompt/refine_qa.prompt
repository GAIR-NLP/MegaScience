Below is a question-and-answer pair. Refine the answer based on the following requirements:

- **If the answer does not contain any explanation or intermediate reasoning process**:
  - Add only necessary intermediate reasoning process leading to the given answer
  - Ensure the added steps are logical, clear, and provide necessary explanation of the solution process

- **If the answer already includes necessary solution process**:
  - Reorganize the solution into a clear and well-structured format for better readability and understanding
  - for simple solutions, there is no need to use latex format

- **If the final answer is a specific result that can be evaluated by exact matching**:
  - Place the final answer inside $\\boxed{}$ notation
  - This applies to answers for multiple-choice questions, calculation problems, fill-in-the-blank questions, and true/false questions

- Maintain the original question text and provide the refined answer in the same format:
  - Question: <question text>
  - Answer: <refined solution>

#### The question:
`<PROBLEM>`

#### The answer:
`<ANSWER>`

Suppose you are a teacher, you should explain the solution in a way that is easy for a student to understand. Now process the pair and return the refined result.
