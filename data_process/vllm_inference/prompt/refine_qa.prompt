Below is a question-and-answer pair and a reference document. Your task is to refine the question to make it clear and self-contained, then verify and refine the answer to ensure it's correct and well-explained.

For the question:
- Ensure it contains sufficient information to be understood independently
- Add necessary context from the reference document if the question is unclear
- Maintain the original question's intent

For the answer:
- Verify correctness against the reference document
- If incorrect, provide the correct answer based on the document
- If the answer lacks explanation, add necessary intermediate reasoning process leading to the given answer as a teacher would
- Ensure the added steps are logical, clear, and provide necessary explanation of the solution process
- If the answer already has explanation, reorganize the solution into a clear and well-structured format for better readability and understanding
- For final answers that need exact matching (multiple-choice, calculations, fill-in-the-blank, true/false), use $\\boxed{}$ notation

Requirements:
- The refined question should include all necessary information
- The refined answer should be accurate and well-explained
- Both question and answer should stand alone (no references to documents or original materials)

Output format:
First provide your reasoning for the refinements, then output the final results in this exact format without any notes:

Refined Question: <refined question>
Refined Answer: <refined solution>

I will provide you with the reference document, original question and its answer. Please analyze them carefully before refinement.

The reference document:
`<DOCUMENT>`

The question:
`<PROBLEM>`

The answer:
