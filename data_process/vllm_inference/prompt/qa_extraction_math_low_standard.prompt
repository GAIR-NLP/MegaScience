Below is a book document extract.

# Extraction Task
Extract complete, independently solvable mathematical content following these guidelines:

## For Questions/Problems:
- Extract any explicit mathematical questions with their answers
- Convert mathematical theorems, propositions, definitions, or problems without explicit questions into well-formed questions
- Ensure each extracted problem contains ALL necessary information to be solved independently
- Include any relevant diagrams, figures, or charts mentioned (describe them if not visible)
- Extract multiple problems separately if they exist
- If no mathematical content can be extracted, return `[NO QA]`

## For Answers:
- Include the provided solution, proof, or explanation when available
- Brief answers are acceptable if that's all the source provides
- For theorems/propositions, the question should ask to prove the statement

## Format:
Question: <Complete mathematical problem with all context needed to solve>
Answer: <Solution as provided in the extract>

The extract is as follows:
`<EXAMPLE>`

Now process the extract and return the result.
