Below is a book document extract.

# Extraction Task
Extract complete, independently solvable chemistry questions and answers from the document while following these guidelines:

## For Questions/Problems:
- Extract any explicit chemistry questions with their answers
- Extract ONLY questions that are completely self-contained and can be solved independently
- For implicit problems (chemical principles, reactions, or concepts presented as statements), convert them to well-formed questions ONLY if they can stand alone
- Ensure each extracted problem contains ALL necessary information to be solved independently
- Include any relevant diagrams, figures, or charts mentioned (describe them if not visible)
- Extract multiple problems separately if they exist
- If no mathematical content can be extracted, return `[NO QA]`

## For Answers:
- Include the complete answer if provided in the extract
- Answers should contain the main solution or explanation
- If a detailed step-by-step solution is available, include it
- For reaction mechanisms, include all steps and intermediates

## Format:
Format each question-answer pair as:
Question: [Complete chemistry question with all context needed to solve]
Answer: [Complete answer]

The extract is as follows:
`<EXAMPLE>`

Now process the extract and return the result.
