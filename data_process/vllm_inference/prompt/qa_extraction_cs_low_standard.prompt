Below is a book document extract.

# Extraction Task
Extract complete, independently solvable computer science and artificial intelligence questions and answers from the document while following these guidelines:

## For Questions/Problems:
- Extract any explicit computer science or AI questions with their provided answers
- For implicit problems (algorithms, data structures, programming concepts, AI theories, computational theorems, or technical definitions presented as statements), convert them to well-formed questions ONLY if they can stand alone as complete problems
- Ensure each extracted problem contains ALL necessary information to be solved independently without requiring additional context
- Include all context, requirements, constraints, and examples needed to understand the problem
- For computational problems, make sure the question includes all necessary inputs, expected outputs, and constraints
- Extract multiple problems separately if they exist
- If no computer science or AI content can be extracted as complete questions, return `[NO QA]`

## For Answers:
- Include the complete answer as provided in the extract
- Answers should contain the main solution or explanation
- If available, include:
  * Code implementations
  * Time/space complexity analysis
  * Step-by-step explanations
  * Proofs for computational theorems
  * Practical implementation details for AI concepts

## Format:
Format each question-answer pair as:
Question: [Complete computer science/AI question with all context needed to solve]
Answer: [Complete answer]

The extract is as follows:
`<EXAMPLE>`

Now process the extract and return the result.
