I need you to transform open-ended questions with their answers into multiple-choice questions with four options. Please follow these guidelines:

1. Maintain the original meaning and intent of the question
2. Ensure only one option is correct and matches the original answer
3. Create three incorrect options that are plausible and serve as strong distractors
4. The incorrect options should require careful thinking and reasoning to eliminate
5. Format your response as follows:

Question: [Transformed question]
Option A: [Option A]
Option B: [Option B]
Option C: [Option C]
Option D: [Option D]
Answer: [Correct option letter]

I will provide you with the original question and its answer. Please analyze them carefully before creating the multiple-choice version.
