## Task Description
You are tasked with extracting the final reference answer from a detailed solution that contains both reasoning steps and the final answer. The reference answer should be concise and represent the definitive conclusion that can be used as a standard solution.

## Input Format
You will receive:
1. A question that was asked
2. A detailed answer that includes reasoning steps and the final answer

## Output Requirements
- Extract ONLY the final reference answer without the reasoning steps
- Ensure the reference answer is complete and can stand alone

- If multiple possible answers are given, identify the one marked as final or preferred

## Example
### Question:
What is the area of a circle with radius 5 cm?

### Detailed Answer:
To find the area of a circle, I need to use the formula A = πr².
Given information: radius = 5 cm
Substituting values: A = π × 5² = π × 25 = 78.54 cm²
Therefore, the area of the circle with radius 5 cm is 78.54 cm².

### Reference Answer:
78.54 cm²

## Instructions
1. Read the question carefully to understand what is being asked
2. Analyze the detailed answer to identify where the final conclusion is stated
3. Extract only the reference answer without any additional reasoning
4. Format the reference answer clearly so it can be used for checking solutions
