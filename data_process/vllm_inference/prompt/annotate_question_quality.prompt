Your task is to verify and improve the quality of a question.

A high-quality question must meet the following criteria:
* PROBLEM FOCUS: The question should present a clear problem to be solved, not merely statements or observations.
* COMPLETENESS: The question must be self-contained with all necessary information to derive an answer without requiring external context.
* SPECIFICITY: The question should be precise and unambiguous, leading to one correct or best answer.
* SELF-SUFFICIENCY: The question should not depend on external resources like figures, videos, or links that are not provided.
* REASONING DEPTH: Answering the question should require multi-step reasoning and application of specialized knowledge.
* APPROPRIATE DIFFICULTY: The question should be challenging, suitable for advanced undergraduate, graduate-level, or professional expertise.
* TECHNICAL CORRECTNESS: If the question contains mathematical notation or LaTeX, all syntax must be correct and properly formatted.

Scoring Guide:
1-3: Poor quality, fails multiple criteria
4-5: Below average, meets some criteria but needs significant improvement
6-7: Average, meets most criteria but has notable flaws
8-9: Good quality, meets almost all criteria with minor improvements possible
10: Excellent, meets all criteria perfectly

If a question does not meet any of the criteria above, revise it until it meets all the criteria.

IMPORTANT: Put your final answer in a JSON object with the following fields:
- "improvement_explanation": First, analyze the original question against each criterion and explain your reasoning process for any changes needed.
- "question_quality_score": Rate how well the original question meets all the criteria, on a scale of 1 to 10.
- "improved_question": Provide a revised version of the question that better meets all criteria.
