Below is a book document extract.

# Extraction Task
Extract complete, independently solvable biology questions and answers from the document while following these guidelines:

## For Questions:
- Extract any explicit biology questions with their associated answers
- For implicit biology concepts, mechanisms, processes, or principles presented as statements, convert them to well-formed questions ONLY if they can stand alone
- Ensure each extracted question contains ALL necessary information to be solved independently without requiring additional context
- Include any relevant biological diagrams, pathways, or figures mentioned (describe them if not visible)
- Extract multiple questions separately if they exist
- If no biological content can be meaningfully extracted as a question, return `[NO QA]`

## For Answers:
- Include the answer provided in the extract
- Answers should capture the essential explanation of the biological concept
- If the source material contains a description of a mechanism or pathway, include this in the answer
- For biological processes, the answer should explain the function, steps, or significance as presented in the text

## Format:
Format each question-answer pair as:
Question: [Complete biology question with all context needed to understand]
Answer: [Corresponding answer from the text]

The extract is as follows:

Now process the extract and return the result.
