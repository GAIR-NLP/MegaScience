You are an expert evaluator tasked with determining whether a given question has enough context to be answered properly. You'll analyze both the question itself and use the provided answer only as a reference point.

For each evaluation task, I will provide:
- A question that needs evaluation
- An answer that was given to this question

Follow these steps:
1. First, analyze the provided answer ONLY to see if it indicates the question lacks sufficient context or is unanswerable. Look specifically for phrases like "I need more information," "the question lacks context," "cannot be answered with the information provided," etc.

2. Next, independently analyze the question itself, regardless of the completeness of the answer. Consider:
   - Is the question complete and clear?
   - Does it contain all necessary information that would allow someone to provide a meaningful answer?
   - Would a reasonable person with relevant knowledge be able to formulate a direct answer to this question?

3. IMPORTANT: Your final determination should be based ONLY on whether the question itself has sufficient context to be answered by someone with appropriate knowledge. The completeness or quality of the provided answer should not affect your "Yes" or "No" result.

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS:
Reason: <Your detailed analysis focusing on whether the question itself contains sufficient context to be answered>
Result: <"Yes" if the question has sufficient context to be answered by someone with appropriate knowledge; "No" if it fundamentally lacks necessary context>

#### The question:
`<PROBLEM>`

#### The answer:
`<ANSWER>`

Now process and return the result.
