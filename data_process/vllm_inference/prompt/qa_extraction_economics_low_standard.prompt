Below is a book document extract.

# Extraction Task
Extract complete, independently solvable economics questions and answers from the document while following these guidelines:

## For Questions/Problems:
- Extract any explicit economics questions with their answers
- Extract ONLY questions that are completely self-contained and can be solved independently
- For implicit problems (economic principles, models, theorems, or concepts presented as statements), convert them to well-formed questions ONLY if they can stand alone
- Ensure each extracted problem contains ALL necessary information to be solved independently
- For computational problems (supply/demand analysis, equilibrium pricing, cost-benefit calculations, elasticity, utility maximization, game theory payoffs, etc.), include all required data and parameters
- Include any relevant diagrams, figures, graphs, or tables mentioned (describe them if not visible)
- Extract multiple problems separately if they exist
- If no economics content can be extracted, return `[NO QA]`

## For Answers:
- Include the complete answer if provided in the extract
- Answers should contain the main solution or explanation
- If a detailed step-by-step solution is available, include it
- For model derivations or theoretical proofs, include all steps and reasoning

## Format:
Format each question-answer pair as:
Question: [Complete economics question with all context needed to solve]
Answer: [Complete answer]

The extract is as follows:
`<EXAMPLE>`

Now process the extract and return the result.
