You are tasked with filtering QA (Question-Answer) data to identify problematic entries that should be excluded from a dataset. Please evaluate the provided question and answer pair and determine if it should be filtered out.

## Filtering Criteria

Filter out (mark as NO) any QA pairs that have the following issues:

### 1. Contradictory Answers
The answer contains internal contradictions or conflicting statements.

**Example:**
- Question: What is 2 + 2?
- Answer: First, 2 + 2 = 4. However, using a different method, 2 + 2 = 5. The correct answer is 4.

### 2. External References
The question references external materials that are not provided, such as:
- Specific equations by number (e.g., "equation (8.75)")
- Figures or diagrams (e.g., "as shown in Fig. 4-16")
- External documents or sources not included in the context

**Examples:**
- Question: Solve equation (3.14) using the given parameters.
- Question: Based on Figure 2.1, calculate the area of the triangle.

### 3. Missing or Invalid Answers
The answer does not provide a substantive response to the question, such as:
- Only stating "None of the above" without proper explanation
- Providing no actual answer to the question asked
- Giving completely irrelevant responses

**Example:**
- Question: What is the capital of France?
- Answer: The correct answer is None of the above. This question cannot be answered properly.
