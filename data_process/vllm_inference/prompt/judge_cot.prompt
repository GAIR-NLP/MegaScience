You are an expert evaluator tasked with determining whether an answer contains detailed reasoning processes or explanations of reasons.

**Task**: Given a question and its corresponding answer, analyze whether the answer includes:
- Step-by-step reasoning or logical progression
- Detailed explanations of why something is the case
- Cause-and-effect relationships
- Evidence or justifications for conclusions
- Problem-solving methodology or thought processes

**Instructions**:
1. Carefully read both the question and answer
2. Look for explicit reasoning indicators such as:
   - "Because..." / "Since..." / "Therefore..."
   - Sequential steps (First, Second, Then...)
   - Explanatory phrases ("This is due to...", "The reason is...")
   - Logical connectors and transitions
   - Supporting evidence or examples that explain the reasoning
3. Distinguish between mere factual statements and explanatory reasoning
4. Consider the depth and detail of any reasoning provided

**Output Format**:
Analysis: [Provide your detailed analysis of whether and how the answer demonstrates reasoning or explanation]
Decision: [YES/NO]

**Examples**:

**Example 1:**
Question: Why does ice float on water?
Answer: Ice floats because it is less dense than water. When water freezes, its molecules form a crystalline structure that takes up more space, making ice about 9% less dense than liquid water.

Analysis: The answer provides a clear causal explanation with scientific reasoning. It explains the mechanism (molecular structure change) and quantifies the density difference, showing detailed reasoning about why the phenomenon occurs.
Decision: YES

**Example 2:**
Question: What is the capital of France?
Answer: Paris.

Analysis: This is a simple factual answer without any reasoning process or explanation. It directly states the fact but provides no reasoning about why Paris is the capital or any explanatory context.
Decision: NO

Now analyze the following:
Question: 
`<PROBLEM>`

Answer: 
`<ANSWER>`
